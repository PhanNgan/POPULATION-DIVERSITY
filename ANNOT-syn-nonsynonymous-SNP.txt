##### ANNOTATION OF synonymous and  nonsynonymous SNP using snpEff
Follow these steps

- Inside snpEff directory create a new directory called data
- Inside data create a new directory called mgram
- Inside mgram directory you need to add the following files
- The fasta file renamed into sequences.fa
- The gff3 file renamed into genes.gff
- The cds file renamed into cds.fa (Each header should have the mRNA: added before the id - for example >mg1g0000001 should be >mRNA:mg1g0000001 ; you can use sed for that sed 's/>/>mRNA:/' file1 > file2)
- The protein file renamed into proteins.fa (same header change as for the cds)
- Edit snpEff.config file and add the following two lines at the end
# Meloidogyne graminicola
mgram.genome : Meloidogyne graminicola
 Run from inside the snpEff directory
java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v mgram

The header change has to happen because naming comes from the ID tag in the gff file (ID=mRNA:mg1g0000001;Name=mg1g0000001;Parent=gene:mg1g0000001)

java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v mgram

java -jar snpEff.jar eff -v mgram input.vcf > output.vcf

bedtools intersect -header -a annotated_output.vcf -b regions.bed > extracted_snps_in_regions.vcf

##to extract SNPs in hetero regions

bedtools intersect -header -a  -b regions.bed > extracted_snps_in_regions.vcf
